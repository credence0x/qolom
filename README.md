# Standing, The Virtual Queuing App
<br>
Hey there and welcome :smiley:.<br><br>

This is a virtual queuing app that doubles as an ordering platform.
<br><br>

There are two major aspects to this application i.e.<br><br>
(1) there is the business side and<br>
(2) the user side.
<br><br>

(1)A business may register,create virtual queues and then have people join their queues. They can also remove users from the queue whenever they want (e.g immediately they are done attending to them ).<br>

The business may also incorporate an ordering system as well as a payment system and have full control over it. Pretty cool right? :grinning:<br><br>


(2) The user side is where clients get to sign up and join queues. 
Users also have the option of ordering from businesses paying through through paystack (stripe for Africa) which we intergrated into the app.<br>

This app was primarily built with python django and postgresql 

<br><br>
The app is live at https://qolom.com and I'll encourage you to check it out.
